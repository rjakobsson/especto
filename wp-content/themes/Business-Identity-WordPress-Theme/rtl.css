/**
 * The RTL styles for Business Identity have been put inside of
 * style.css with .rtl prepended in front of the corresponding RTL rules.
 *
 * The reasons for this are as follows:
 *
 * 1. One less server hit when RTL sites are active, thus better performance.
 * 2. Putting RTL overrides into a separate file is an organizational nightmare,
 *	  and incredibly difficult to maintain.
 * 3. Adopting a practice of overriding styles with RTL rules within style.css
 *	  reduces the out of sight, out of mind problem of updates and fixes
 *	  where corresponding RTL overrides are forgotten.
 * 4. There does not appear to be a significant justification for putting RTL rules
 *	  into their own file when simply using .rtl (body-provided) in front of rules
 *	  as overrides will suffice.
