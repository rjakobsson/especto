## Featured Images ##

Business Identity is a theme that's designed to allow you show off your images. You may have been using another theme before switching to Business Identity or you may have had a lot of images uploaded to your WordPress media library [1] before activating Business Identity on your site. If this is the case, then please download and install the Regenerate Thumbnails [2] plugin. This is an essential step towards making sure that your website loads images at a sensible size and also ensures that any old images that you've uploaded into your site before activating the theme are accounted for.

Business Identity uses Jetpack [1] to assist with customer testimonials handling, featured content, portfolios, infinite scroll, and image optimization, to name a few features. We highly recommend that in order to get the most out of your website with Business Identity you install Jetpack. It was built to bring the power of WordPress.com to self-hosted WordPress installations, and it will make your self-hosted installation of Business Identity shine just like it does on WordPress.com.
