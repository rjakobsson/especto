# Translating Business Identity

Business Identity, like WordPress, uses English by default.

If you would like to use Business Identity in your language, then head over to the [Business Identity translations page](https://translate.prothemesonline.com/projects/business-identity) and download your language pack for the theme. Once you've downloaded your language pack, put it into this folder (/languages). That's it. 

## Theme Users
